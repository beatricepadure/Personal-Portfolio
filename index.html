        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello.My name is Padure Beatrice and I am currently in 10th grade.
             I was born and raised in Moldova.
            I would say I am an artistic person that enjoys drawing and music,
             since I find them as an easy way to relax.
            From school subjects, I really like mathematics,
             english and informatics because I find all of these very useful in 
            real life.
        </p>

        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p>I started drawing since I was in first grade, and I would say it is both a passion
            of mine and a skill that I have gotten over the years. I have won a few awards, 
            like a diploma for 1st place in the international contest "Prolectura", an art 
            and literature competition. I find that playing guitar is more of a hobby for me,
            since I started doing this 2 years ago and haven't gotten a chance to practice more
            often because of school. I also have language skills, since I can speak romanian and 
            english fluently, and aside from that I learnt german and turkish on A2 level.
        </p>

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p> I have some editing experience because of 2 school projects I did related to cooking,
            one being in english and one in romanian.

        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>From kindergarten till 4th grade, I studied at a school in my town called "Ilie Fulga".
           In 5th grade I moved to Theoretical Lyceum "Orizont", since my previous school was only
           an elementary school. Then, in 8th grade I moved to "Orizont" in Durlesti for 10th-12th 
           classes. In 6th grade I won second place for a local competition called "Comper" and in 8th
           grade I participated in a sports competition called "La starturi vesele!".
